              <h3>Self Balancing Robot</h3>
              <p>Designed and developed a two wheeled self-balancing robot for hospital use. Used an iterative approach, starting with basic movement and gathering gyroscopic information, then designed a PID controller to allow it to start self balancing.</p>
              <p>Aided in the designing the robot, engineering drawings, CAD models, assembly manuals, and demonstrations of the prototype.</p>
              <p>Used both DC and BLDC motors, with motor controllers such as the L298N and ODrive for different iterations of the prototype.</p>
              <p>Adapted existing solutions on PID controllers to allow our self-balancing to function as intended.</p>

              <p>Designed a website from scratch using extremely limited knowledge (at the time) of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to pull from NASA's API and allow users to like and comment on images from NASA.</p>
              <p>Designed custom avatars and backgrounds to allow for personalized profile pictures locally while navigating the site.</p>

              <h3>Autonomous Robot</h3>
              <p>Programmed a robot capable of autonomous travel, and obstacle detection/avoidance using a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit.</p>
              <p>The robot was programmed using C++, and utilized a variety of sensors, including an Ultrasonic sensor, Gyroscopic sensor and Colour sensor to avoid a solid colour barrier and randomly placed objects around the arena.</p>
              <p>Aided in other project documentation and report writing, documenting the progress over the course of the semester.</p>
