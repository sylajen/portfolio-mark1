          <h3>Self Balancing Robot</h3>
          <img src="images/robojan.png" alt="description of image">
          <p>Designed and developed a two wheeled self-balancing robot for hospital use. Used an iterative approach, starting with basic movement and gathering gyroscopic information, then designed a PID controller to allow it to start self balancing.</p>
          <p>Aided in the designing the robot, engineering drawings, CAD models, assembly manuals, and demonstrations of the prototype.</p>
          <p>Used both DC and BLDC motors, with motor controllers such as the L298N and ODrive for different iterations of the prototype.</p>
          <p>Adapted existing solutions on PID controllers to allow our self-balancing to function as intended.</p>

          <h3>Autonomous Robot</h3>
          <!--<img src="" alt="description of image">-->
          <p>Programmed a robot capable of autonomous travel, and obstacle detection/avoidance using a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit.</p>
          <p>The robot was programmed using C++, and utilized a variety of sensors, including an Ultrasonic sensor, Gyroscopic sensor and Colour sensor to avoid a solid colour barrier and randomly placed objects around the arena.</p>
          <p>Aided in other project documentation and report writing, documenting the progress over the course of the semester.</p>
